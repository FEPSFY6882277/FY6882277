           Currently, the construction industry is always trying to improve the efficiency, sustainability and adaptability of the construction process and with the advanced 
           technologies we have today, there is hope that the goal is achievable. Augmented/Virtual reality (AR/VR), additive manufacturing (3D printing) and nanotechnology are
           three among the many technologies which would majorly revolutionise construction, as in the case for additive manufacturing has shown its capability to significantly make the 
           construction process more efficient, reduce waste and lower the costs by printing the necessary building components with high precision. Along with additive manufacturing, 
           nanotechnology has been demonstrated to have greatly benefited the strength and durability of construction materials while also reducing the environmental footprint of 
           the construction process. Alternatively, the use of AR and VR has been shown to aid the planning and execution aspect of the construction process the use of AR and VR, as it 
           provides designers with tools to fully visualise the project and help in joint designing and making decisions in real-time.  In this web article I will show how the future of 
           construction will be impacted using these three technologies.

         As the construction industry continues to evolve, with new technologies playing a critical role in reinventing outdated construction practices, and from these technologies 
         that have been developed the most noteworthy developments are additive manufacturing (3D printing), nanotechnology and AR and VR. Using these technologies within construction 
         process will bring change to modular construction, the durability of construction material, and improve project management, while at the same time bringing new solutions to 
         existing challenges (i.e. reducing waste, labour shortages and the lack of organisation during construction projects).

          Recently, the construction industry has started to adopt additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, because it allows construction workers to print building components 
          by depositing building materials, typically concrete or other specialised composites. Furthermore, the ability of additive printing to produce intricate and configurable geometries 
          that are challenging to duplicate with earlier construction techniques is another reason why it is superior to conventional construction techniques.

         <p class="p.ex1">

         In modular construction, additive manufacturing (AM) is used to print prefabricated building modules or components under controlled conditions, which are subsequently put together on
         location. This procedure shortens project deadlines and eliminates the need for labour-intensive construction work. By manufacturing entire buildings and even multi-story structures 
         in a fraction of the time needed for traditional building methods, companies like WinSun Global have shown off the capabilities of 3D printing (1)(2). Furthermore, printing the necessary
         building components has shown to be an eco-friendlier alternative when compared to traditional construction methods as the printing process significantly reduces the waste of building materials.

         <p class="p.ex1"> 
         <pre>
         Additionally, combining AM with modular building provides a very effective way to solve the housing issue in both developed and developing nations. For example, modular construction methods in
         conjunction with 3D printing are showing promise in inexpensive housing developments. Pilot projects are being started in South Africa to build 3D-printed, climate-resilient homes that use bio-based 
         materials for increased longevity and energy efficiency.
