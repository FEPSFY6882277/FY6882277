           The Bell Rock lighthouse is one described as one of the greatest civil engineering achievements. 
           Its design took inspiration from the Eddystone lighthouse in South of England by John Smeaton. 
           Its shape took inspiration from an oak tree which was wide and base and then slowly narrowed. 
           Robert Stevenson, decided to use Smeaton’s design as a base, considering that the Bell rock was 
           in exceptionally harsh conditions and that Smeaton’s design was a huge success.[3]

           The Bell rock, which the lighthouse was supposed to warn off, guarded the approach to the Firth 
           to Forth hiding beneath the waves for the majority of the time and it claimed any ship that came 
           upon it, creating the rocks deadly reputation[4]. This meant during a storm, ships would face the 
           choice of either braving the open sea or risking an approach to the Firth of Forth. A lighthouse 
           was crucial, but there were many factors that stood in the way: Firstly, the location of the
           rock, which was several kilometres of the east coast of Scotland which created a number of 
           problems, including severe weather exposure, logistics and worker management and structural design 
           challenges. That last was the most significant as in Britian, there were very few offshore
           lighthouses and the rock itself was an issue as its uneven surface was visible briefly for a f
           ew hours at low tide before going back to being submerged under a few feet of water. [1]

         <h3 id="Design Process", style=”font-family:calibri:”>Design Process</h3>
         <p class="p.ex1"> 
         <pre>
           Stevenson’s initial design was a pillar-based lighthouse but upon visiting and rock itself, that 
           design would not work due to the swell around the rock. The next design was based of the Eddystone 
           Lighthouse, the only existing offshore tower at the time. Its designer, John Smeaton, modelled 
           the shape of the lighthouse on an oak tree, He did this based on that ‘we seldom hear of a mature 
           oak tree being uprooted’.[3] Since this was a proven success, Stevenson made his design in line with 
           Smeaton’s. But adjustments had to be made: the Eddystone lighthouse was above sea level, but the Bell 
           rock could be submerged up to sixteen feet in water, meaning that it had to be taller, and therefore
           wider at base and have longer foundations. After his first visit to the Bell Rock, in the year 1800, 
           Stevenson made a variety of drawings, and constructed new models for a building of stone, shewing 
           various methods of connecting the stones, by dovetailing them laterally, like those of the Eddystone 
           lighthouse, and also course to course into one another perpendicularly.[2] At the rock itself, there was 
           about 250 by 130 feet of tough sandstone at low tide, perfect for building a lighthouse on. Finally, 
           Stevenson envisaged a tower that stood over 100 feet tall, 42 feet wide at base and 2 feet embedded 
           in the rock constructed out of stone interlocked in a sturdy dovetail pattern. [1]

           The construction work began in 1807, delayed by a lack of funds: Stevenson calculated that the 
           lighthouse would cost about £42,000 (which is around £2 million in today’s money), which would require
           an Act of Parliament to allow the Lighthouse board to borrow money.[1] The first step was handling logistic
           s and provide adequate living conditions for the workers. For this purpose, 2 ships, were acquired. 
           The Smeaton, for bringing in supplies from shore and the Pharos to serve as temporary accommodation for 
           the workers before the beacon was completed.[1] Said beacon had to be completed before the work on the 
           lighthouse was started so that the workers can have a comfortable accommodation, and to provide a temporary 
           light for the ships out at sea. The iron beam design was surprisingly resistant to the sea and was the 
           first major success on the rock. The next step was building the foundations for the lighthouse itself. The 
           foundations required fifty-four holes, each measuring two inches in diameter, and eighteen inches in depth.[2]
           This task used a chisel and hammer where three men were attached to each jumper or chisel; one placed himself 
           in a sitting posture, to guide the instrument and give it a turn at each blow of the hammer; he also sponged or 
           cleaned out the hole, and supplied it occasionally with a little water; while the other two, with hammers of 
           sixteen pounds weight, struck the jumper alternately, generally bringing the hammer with a swing round the 
           shoulder. The three men relieved each other in the operation of guiding the jumper and striking with the 
           hammers. No modern machinery, just the power of one’s arm.[2] For the tower to rise above the foundations, a 
           crane was needed the chief difficulties attending the application of the common crane in such a situation, 
           consisted in the laying the stones perpendicularly into their respective places, as they were all a dove-tail 
           or angular form. Instead, a moveable beam to work upon a bolt at the foot or lower end of the upright shaft, 
           instead of a fixed beam at the top of the system. [2] Another difficulty was moving the stones from the ships 
           around the rock. To resolve this, the decision to lay cast-iron railways round the site of the Lighthouse, 
           projecting to the several landing-places, was made, on which waggons could easily be wheeled in all 
           directions.[2] The beacon, cranes, railway and ships all allowed the tower to rise in a timely manner. Over the 
           next years, work included building a rope bridge that connected the lighthouse to the beacon and new taller 
           balance cranes specially designed for the Bell rock. By 1810, the last stones were being fitted and the 
           lightroom was constructed. Stevenson chose a unique signal with a red and white reflector light and a
           dditional fog bells to warn ships.[4] On 1 February 1811, the lighthouse was officially finished, and it ended 
           the death toll of the Bell rock, making the passage safe.

           In short, the lighthouse stands to this day after over 200 years, and thus became a universal statement of
           human ingenuity and determination.
